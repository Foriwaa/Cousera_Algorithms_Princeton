## Part 1 : Week 1 - Week 5
## Part 2 : Week 7 - Week 11

Cousera online course, Algorithms, created by Princeton University, taught by: Kevin Wayne, Senior Lecturer and Robert Sedgewick, Professor.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
